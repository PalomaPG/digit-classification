# Requirements

## Python version: 3.6
### Modules and libraries
    - Scikit-learn 0.19.1: neural\_network, model\_selection, metrics
    - Numpy 1.13.3
    - Itertools
    - Matplotlib 2.2.2: pyplot
    - Random : shuffle

# Execution

In a terminal type the following command

 $ python main.py <input\_path> <output\_path>

Where <input_path> is the path containing the data file *1\_digits.txt* and the <output\_path> corresponds to the path
we want to save our generated (by the program) plots.

When the program is finished, check the <output\_path>. Sometimes the results take time to be written on disk,
but don't worry they will appear. :-)
